Files:
"ZOOV212-prac-4-data" is data in an excel file from an old Zoology practical from my second year. The prac focused on species diversity in varying size classifications of rockpools along the coast of Port Elizabeth.
"please_work" is an Rstudio file that contains the tidy data of the practical which was then plotted into a bar graph. Note, ignore the "please_work.R" in the main section of the repository. Instead open "please_work" inside the "data" folder.
